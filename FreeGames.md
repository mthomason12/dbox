# Introduction #

D-Box doesn't have much value without DOS applications. We have therefore decided to create a list of free games and applications that you may install and run through D-Box. _You won't find illegal abandonware here, just legal quality applications_. Please contact me using [Twitter](http://twitter.com/truben), or post a comment if you know about a game we should be aware of.

## Jetpack ##

Jetpack was an immediate hit when it was released in 1993, and a cult following grew internationally. I received a ton of mail and submissions by people creating their own jetpack levels. The built in level editor is one of the most popular features - over 1000 levels have been created. Some teachers bought Jetpack because they considered the editor to be educational, encouraging their students' creativity.
