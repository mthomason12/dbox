**Q:** What does "how fast would you like the computer?" mean?

**A:** DosBox doesn't only emulate DOS, it also emulates a x86 processor (CPU).  If you set the emulation speed to very fast, DosBox will need more CPU power to do the emulation.

Some older games use the CPU speed to set the speed of the game. If this happens, you have to slow down the emulation speed so that it matches the speed of the computers from the era the game was created.

You can change the speed of the emulated CPU while you're running a program. Hit CTRL-F11 to slow down the emulation and CTRL-F12 to speed it up.

**Q:** When I double click on D-Box, WinRAR opens up. What the #"$@?

**A:** D-Box is distributed as an executable JAR file. JAR files are in reality only a special kind of ZIP files. You should not try to extract the files from the JAR-file. If your operating system doesn't want to run D-Box when you double click on it, try to right-click on it, and select "Run as..." and then "JAR - Executable JAR" or something similar.

You can't currently run 32bit Windows programs (Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, XP, VISTA, 7), but you can run Windows 3.1, and therefor indirectly run 16bit Windows applications and games.
