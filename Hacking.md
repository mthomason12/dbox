# About the source code #

D-Box is completely open source, which means that you can take the source code and modify it. I created D-Box using [Netbeans 7](http://netbeans.org), so I recommend everybody to use the same tool if you want to start hacking.

If you make any useful changes, please contact me! (i.e. add a comment on this page)

Most of the fun stuff is in MainWindow.java:)
