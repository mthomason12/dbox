D-Box is a simple, yet powerful front-end for DosBox. It provides a slick GUI that allows users to run games and applications through DosBox without writing any cryptic commands. It strives to be easy to use and not too complicated. D-Box is multi-platform, and supports all platforms that DosBox does. D-Box is [open source](http://code.google.com/p/dbox/source/browse/#svn/DBox2/src/dbox2). [What's new in D-Box 2.3](whatsnew23.md).
