# Introduction #

D-Box makes it easy to launch application through DOSBox, but before you can play, you have to add them to D-Box' internal library. Fortunately, this is both fast and easy.

_Make sure you have the newest version of D-Box!_


## The easiest way: Drag and drop ##

This is by far the best way to add applications to D-Box:

  * Make sure D-Box is running
  * Navigate to the application in your file explorer (usually Finder on Mac, Windows Explorer on Windows, Dolphine on KDE, etc.)
  * Click and drag the game's folder or the main executable file into D-Box using your mouse. Release the button.
  * Choose the correct application name from the drop down menu, or select "Something else.." if none of the choices apply.
  * D-Box will automatically search through the directory for useful files (setup files and icons) and use these.

## A more advanced way ##

If your game needs more tweaking, like adding a CD-ROM, you may want to add it using a more advanced method. _Note: You may edit any application using the Edit Game menu. It doesn't matter how you added it._

  * Click on the "Edit Game Preferences" icon and select "New Game"
  * Fill in the fields, or select "Wizard" to let D-Box guide you through the most importaint steps.
  * Click OK when you're done.
